Psuedo Code for Main Page
-Dependencies imported

- Need a component for Banner Image
- Need a component for Nav Banner

Main Page
- Will make get request from here so need to define state and usestate
State: "resp.data" is all I need for first page since nothing else will change at this level?
useEffect to get the GTR data from Air Table, load data into state, render on page

To Do's
- Need to figure out how Drop Down works and if what I'm thinking will work
- Or I could use different buttons to display the Top 10 - Top 25 - Top 50
- Eventually show Rank *  imageSmall * Guitarist Name
- Name will link to page with guitarist bio information


Guitarist Page
State:
- I think I can just use the resp.data for state again.  The change will be all the data thats coming in?  Maybe the Air Table ID?
 - Will need state for Vote count

Params
- Rank
- Gtr
- Bands
- Genre
- Image Large
- Best Song
- Best Solo
- Wiki link

To Do's
- Will need a button for voting on greatest Guitarist ever
- Will need logic for counting the votes
- Will need field in air table to save the count 
- Will need a PUT to send vote count to database
- Need to look into cards on Material and Bootstrap to hold results

Guitar Wars
- Randomly select gutiarist one - dipsplay image and Name
- Randomly generate guitarist two - display image and Name
- Buttons for each to capture vote
- Maybe add a total wins variable to track all the gtr victories
  Will need another state and field for that in Air Table



Make your own list page
Not sure how I would do this, think I will need two different databases
If so, then GET and display list on left 1/2 of screen 
-figure out how to do that
Form on the right half of screen for just the following
PUT request
- Rank
- Gtr
- Best Song
- Best Solo

DELETE Button to get rid of the guitarist who are not worthy
-maybe add a your rank field to air table??
-PATCH  request ? update that field only
